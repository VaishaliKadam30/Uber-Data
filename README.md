Deliverables

Data Analysis : In this stage extracts useful information statistically. Such as check outliers,
skewness, compare the features by graph and many more. Do all the required steps as well.

This process involves performing

1. Univariate Analysis : In this part, first check target features and start univariate
analysis.

2. Bivariate analysis : This analysis involves studying two variables and their relationship,
recalling some of the hypotheses that we generated earlier.

3. Removing Missing values if any : After exploring all the variables in our data, we can
now impute the missing values and treat the outliers because missing data and outliers
can have an adverse effect on the model performance and accuracy.
